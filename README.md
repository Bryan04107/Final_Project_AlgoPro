## The Basics
- This game is inspired by the game "Touhou Project".
- The goal of the game is to beat the opposing slime while dodging its projectiles.
- At the start of the game, three difficulties can be chosen and upon victory or defeat the player can choose to leave or replay.
- The player can move with "W, A, S, D".
- The player can dash with "Space Bar".
- The player can shoot with "Left Click" for a singular shot or "Right Click" for a burst shot.
- The player's score is calculated with the difficulty and remaining player health.
- If the player losses if they are hit with a projectile dropping their health to 0.
- If the player wins if the opposing slime health drops to 0 and survives its final attack.
